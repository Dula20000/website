Have this in every page for tracking users. put right before the body ends

<!--this is the tracking code snippet from cloudfair worker and worker Kv. It uses FingerprintJS to log everything needed to fingerprint users. have this in all html files going forward.-->

Also put this in relevant areas to implement a loading screen for any page.

<style src="https://dulran.com/styles/loadingscreenstyling.css"> </style>
<div id="animation"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lottie-web@latest/build/player/lottie.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://dulran.com/scripts/loadingscreens/one.js"></script>

This is the best method as an alternative for a loading screen. This redirect to a loaded screen HTML file and that file shows the loading then it redirects back to the original file.

<script src="https://dulran.com/scripts/redirecttoloadingscreen.js"></script>   -- put this in the header of each HTML file.
